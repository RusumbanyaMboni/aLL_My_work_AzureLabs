    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><strong>Sweet Cravings Bakery</strong> was founded in January 2019 by pastry chef <strong>Kayla R. Naidoo</strong>. Inspired by her grandmother’s love for baking, Kayla turned her home-based cake hobby into a full-time business that has since become a local favourite in Durban North, KwaZulu-Natal.</p>

    <p>Our bakery is best known for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom-designed cakes for all occasions</li>
      <li>Freshly baked artisanal breads</li>
      <li>Delicious pastries and sweet treats</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To become Durban’s go-to bakery for quality, creativity, and exceptional customer service.</p>
    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Local residents, event planners, and corporate buyers looking for unique, high-quality baked goods.</p>
